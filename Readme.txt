Multiple Files Text Replacer

This simple program allows you to select a folder and file filter, then replace a string in all the selected files with another string. Simple as that!

It has been updated on 20-01-2009 to include additional features:
- Can now choose to only search files that have been selected in the file list (thanks Rde!)
- Displays a list of all changed files
- Gives option to select files changed in file list box
- Can 'Find Only' - ie. Don't replace text, just show a list of files found
